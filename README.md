## Description
This project is the just the backend js for an E-commerce website which is all done in the server. the main focus was in using api routes to work with the data inside the websites database. The main routes we are working with are get, put, Post, and delete, the first route the get route gets the data that the user requests, the user and request for all the data in a data catagory or they can search by an id value. An example of this is when the user is searching for a catagory on the website they can either search for all catagories or search for one by id, this data will also include the product data that is connected to the catatgory being searched. The next route is a put route which just allows the user to update values inside the database. A post route allows the user to create new catagoriesm products, tags and product tags and add them to the current database which they can be refrenced later. the last route is a the delete route which allows the user to delete any data from the database by id, the user would need to input an id to delete it from the the database.
